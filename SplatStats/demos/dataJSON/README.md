Place your downloaded JSON folders here!

These are downloaded with [s3s](https://github.com/frozenpandaman/s3s) and will have names like: "export-1663442390"; where the number will change somewhat arbitrarily.

The structure of the folder should looks as follows:

```
dataJSON
    export-1663442390
        coop_results.json
        overview.json
        results.json
    export-1663442341
        coop_results.json
        overview.json
        results.json
    export-1663442130
        coop_results.json
        overview.json
        results.json
    ...
```
