.. SplatStats' docs!
.. ======================================

This python package was created to track personal `Splatoon 3 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splatoon_3>`_ online matches data.
It does this by reading JSON files downloaded by the `s3s <https://github.com/frozenpandaman/s3s>`_, converting the most useful information into dataframes, and more manageable structures for data analysis. 
`SplatStats <https://pypi.org/project/SplatStats/>`_ can also generate `plots <./plots.html>`_ that summarize information about the history of your matches and stats.
